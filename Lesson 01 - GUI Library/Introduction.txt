✅ What is Tkinter?
	Tkinter is the standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) library for Python. It provides tools to create windows, buttons, text fields, labels, and other GUI elements. Tkinter is included with most Python distributions and is an excellent way to build simple desktop applications.

✅ Getting Started with Tkinter
To use Tkinter in a Python script, you need to import it first:
import tkinter as tk


✅ Basic Structure of a Tkinter Program
Here’s a simple example of how a basic Tkinter application is structured:
import tkinter as tk

# Create the main application window
root = tk.Tk()

# Set the title of the window
root.title("My First Tkinter App")

# Set the size of the window (optional)
root.geometry("300x200")

# Add a label widget
label = tk.Label(root, text="Hello, Tkinter!")
label.pack()

# Run the application
root.mainloop()
Explanation:

tk.Tk()     - initializes the main window.
title()     - sets the window title.
geometry()  - optionally sets the window size.
Label 	      creates a text label widget.
pack() 	      places the widget in the window.
mainloop()    keeps the window open and listens for events (clicks, key presses, etc.).
